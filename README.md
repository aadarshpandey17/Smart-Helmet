# Smart Helmet
🔹 Smart Helmet Description  The Smart Helmet is an IoT and sensor-based safety system designed to enhance rider protection and promote safe driving practices. It integrates multiple sensors and communication modules to monitor riding conditions and send alerts in case of emergencies.  🛠️ Components Used  Arduino Uno – The main microcontroller that processes sensor data and controls the system.  SIM900 GSM Module – Enables SMS or call communication to emergency contacts in case of an accident or unsafe condition.  Accelerometer (e.g., ADXL335/ADXL345) – Detects sudden changes in motion or tilt to identify accidents.  Vibration Sensor – Senses shocks or collisions, confirming accident detection with accelerometer data.  MQ3 Alcohol Sensor – Detects alcohol presence in the rider’s breath; if alcohol is detected, the bike ignition will not start.  Power Supply (Battery/Adapter) – To power Arduino and sensors.  ⚙️ Working Principle  Helmet Wearing Detection (optional feature) – A switch or IR sensor can ensure the rider wears the helmet before starting the vehicle.  Alcohol Detection (MQ3) – If alcohol is detected, the ignition system remains disabled, preventing drunk driving.  Accident Detection (Accelerometer + Vibration Sensor) –  If an accident occurs, a sudden change in acceleration and vibration is detected.  Arduino processes this data to confirm the accident.  Emergency Communication (SIM900) –  Once an accident is confirmed, the GSM module sends an SMS with location (if GPS integrated) or alert message to predefined emergency contacts.  Can also trigger a call to family/ambulance services.  Data Logging (Optional) – Accident data or rider health conditions can be logged for further analysis.
